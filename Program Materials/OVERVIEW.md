# LinkedIn Women In Tech (WIT) High School Trainee Program Overview and Philosophy

## Vision to Values

### Vision
Inspire the next generation to study computer science and related fields.

### Mission
Allow students with less exposure to technology the opportunity to gain deep understanding of technology careers before making college decisions.

### Target Audiences
Men and women in technical roles in the company and high school students outside the company with STEM capabilities who may have little exposure to the technology industry and what software engineering is like as a career.

### Strategy
Provide a long-term, immersive experience where students can experience what it means to be a software engineer in a technology setting by providing support from: an inclusive environment, engaged mentors, a robust Women in Tech community, and key executives.

### Key Metrics and Objectives
* NPS score for high school trainees as measured in post-survey
* NPS score for mentors as measured in post-survey
* % of trainees planning to study STEM as measured in post-survey
* % of trainees planning to study computer or information science as measured in post-survey

### Culture
Inclusion | Empowerment | Transformation

### Values
Relationships matter | Take intelligent risks

## Summary

The program focuses on embedding students in a software engineering team for seven to eight weeks. While students learn important technical skills from their mentors, the main objective of the program is for students to develop identities as software engineers and be able to concretely see themselves thriving in the technology industry in the future. This identity forms the foundation from which they will seek to continue studies in computer science or related STEM fields. To date, LinkedIn has hosted 27 high school trainees, with 96% planning to pursue STEM majors and 89% planning to pursue computer science in particular.

This open source project is the outcome of the third year of the program. As LinkedIn has run two prior pilots and prepares to embark upon a third cohort, this body of work represents learnings to date. The goal of the open source project is to inspire and equip other companies to expand the program to provide additional opportunities for students in Silicon Valley and beyond. The desire for access to the program far exceeds the capacity a single corporation can provide. LinkedIn receives thousands of emails and messages from interested students each year, but can only support a program for tens of students.

## Philosophy

There are many students, even in Silicon Valley, who do not understand what it means to be a software engineer and who have little exposure to the technology industry. Additionally, there is a perception amongst young women that software engineers are young men that like to sit in a dark basement coding alone. They do not have exposure to or understanding of the social aspects of being a software engineer.

These students may have high potential to be successful in technology as software engineers, but may not be considering studying appropriate fields due to stereotypes of software engineers portrayed in the media or due to lack of exposure amongst the peer and family relationships. These students are often likely to seek degrees in general subjects rather than STEM and computer science degrees, which would help them prepare for a career in science, technology or software engineering. The goal of the program is to provide the right level of exposure to careers in software engineering in a technology environment to inspire these high potential students to decide to pursue computer science and related degrees.

In order to reach these students, partnerships are created with teachers in schools and districts that have substantially lower exposure to technology and computer science due to their geographic location or by virtue of being in an underfunded school district.

## Overview

### Recruiting Process
In early pilots, LinkedIn recruited by receiving recommendations from partner organizations and teachers. Subsequently, students received a technical screening and a soft-skills screening. However, it became clear that the majority of students that passed through the stages of the process already had a strong inclination to study computer science. The process was changed to target students who had high capability and potential, but were doubtful about pursuing degrees in computer science.

The current process is to target computer science teachers from schools with lower exposure to technology but that do have a computer science class. Once budget is attained for the year and number of students determined, the teachers are asked to refer students that meet a standard bar. The standard bar is that the student is currently enrolled in a computer science course with a grade of B or higher and will be returning to high school the following year. Following referral by the teachers, students receive a soft-skills screening and verification of eligibility for employment.

### Compensation
As the students are potentially coming from more economically challenged homes, it is important to provide them with sufficient compensation to cover transportation costs as well as providing family income, for which they may be required to work. It is important that they be compensated so that the need to work is not a hindrance to participating in the program.

### Program Flow
The program runs over an eight week period that is common between all school districts in the area for a Summer break. The first year, the pilot ran 10 weeks and students were allowed to start and end on different dates. This made it hard to bond the cohort around common events and also put strain on the campus recruiting team. So, now, all trainees start and end on common dates.

The first cohort of trainees worked 40 hours per week. However, this was pretty draining for high school students who are used to shorter days. So, the program was amended to be four days per week, and seven to eight hours per day.

During the Summer, several events are provided to aid cohesion of the cohort and their mentors. The major events are:
1. Orientation
2. Summit where they hear from former trainees and work with executive coaches
3. Team building event
4. End of program presentation to parents

### Pairing
Trainees work in pairs during the Summer to aid them in problem-solving. Each trainee pair has a mentor - in some cases there is an additional mentor from the same engineering team who will assist if the primary mentor is on vacation during the program.

### Work Assignments
During the Summer, trainees complete a full-stack Web application to demonstrate their learning. Additionally, they work on small features, bugs and migrations within their host team. This is so they can push code to production and learn all the enterprise engineering tools.

### Trainee Alumni
Each Summer, a trainee from the former cohort who is still qualified for the program returns as a peer mentor to the new cohort. Additionally, we reach out to former trainees to come and participate in the Trainee Summit - to share what they learned in the program, give advice for continuing studies, and share their experiences from college so far (if applicable). These ongoing interactions with alumni allow us to also keep track of their progress in studying computer science.
