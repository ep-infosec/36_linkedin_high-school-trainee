# Mentor Responsibilities

## Before
1. Review curriculum, decide which parts of the material you want to cover
2. Have "real-world" tasks/project prepared for the trainee(s) to work on throughout the summer; treat trainee as if they were an intern and would need an intern project - project should be a minor feature enhancement or minor cleanup or migration. Think of something that is 1/3 the complexity and duration of what you would prepare for a college intern.
3. Set up success metrics and expectations for the trainee(s), and share with the trainee(s) during the first week
4. Go through mentor training for the curriculum and for HR basics
5. Send trainee intro email before they start. See suggested intro template.

## During
1. Be prepared to spend at least 4 hours each day working closely with the trainees (even more in the first couple of weeks). 1 hour per day is delivering a lecture, and the remaining 3 hours is helping the trainee with lab.
2. Help the trainees with their real-world task, including teaching them about code reviews, deployments, etc.
3. Introduce the trainees to the team on the first day. Make the trainees feel welcome on the team, make sure they're not working off in the corner by themselves.
4. Be aware of social/development activities planned for the trainees, and remind them to attend those.
5. Approve timecards through the summer for your trainee(s).

## After
1. Provide feedback on the program via the mentor survey.
2. Provide feedback on the trainee.
