### COACHING PROGRAM (2 hours)

*OPENING* - How special this experience is - and what it means that they were chosen to participate.

And now, let’s deep dive into several topics that are critical to your success going forward -
Self-Confidence, Growth Mindset, Resilience - and make sure you participate as part of your growth and expansion in these areas!

*EXPERIENCE #1* - How do you each understand and feel about being chosen?
(I’ll keep watch for anyone downplaying etc - re “confidence” - and work with them - with their permission of course.)

*EXPERIENCE #2* - Growth Mindset vs Limited Mindset - How well do you ask for help?
Growth always requires help, but if you have a fixed or limited mindset - you’re likely to be convinced that “there is no help” for you.

*EXPERIENCE #3* - Resilience
You already know life is great at throwing curve balls and putting obstacles in our way. It could be a crummy teacher, a lousy boss, an assignment that doesn’t interest you, the list goes on.Those are examples of where  personal resilience comes into play! AND you will need it for the rest of your professional and personal life. You may imagine that it’s going to get easier, or that you’ll never run into a crummy manager - but that’s just not the case! Sooooo - what about going forward? Please share with us one experience where you rose to the challenge and won! This way we can witness you as the strong resilient person you ARE!

*FINALE (if time)* - What is your #1 Take-Away from today’s meeting!?
